Docker container running FlightRadar24's `fr24feed`. Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf). Builds and runs on `x86_64`, `arm32v6`, `arm32v7` & `arm64`.

`fr24feed` pulls ModeS/BEAST information from the [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf) (or another host providing ModeS/BEAST data), and sends data to FlightRadar24.

For more information on what fr24feed is, see here: [share-your-data](https://www.flightradar24.com/share-your-data).

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` (`main` branch, `Dockerfile`)
* `latest_nohealthcheck` is the same as the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Version and architecture specific tags available

## Obtaining a Flightradar24 Sharing Key

First-time users should obtain a Flightradar24 sharing key.

In order to obtain a Flightradar24 sharing key, initially run the container as-per one of the methods below.

### Script Method

Run the following command to temporarily start the container and complete the automated signup process:

```shell
docker run \
  --rm \
  -it \
  -e FEEDER_LAT="YOUR_FEEDER_LAT" \
  -e FEEDER_LONG="YOUR_FEEDER_LONG" \
  -e FEEDER_ALT_FT="YOUR_FEEDER_ALT_FT" \
  -e FR24_EMAIL="YOUR@EMAIL.ADDRESS" \
  -e FR24_SIGNUP=1 \
  ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-flightradar24:latest
```

Remember to replace:

* `YOUR_FEEDER_LAT` with the latitude of your feeder's antenna
* `YOUR_FEEDER_LONG` with the longitude of your feeder's antenna
* `YOUR_FEEDER_ALT_FT` with the altitude of your feeder's antenna above sea level **in feet**
* `YOUR@EMAIL.ADDRESS` with your email address.

After 30 seconds or so, you should see the following output:

```
FR24_SHARING_KEY=5fa9ca2g9049b615
FR24_RADAR_ID=T-XXXX123
```

Take a note of the sharing key, as you'll need it when launching the container.

### Manual Method

### THIS APPEARS TO BE BROKEN FOR NOW

If the script method fails (please let me know so I can fix it), you can sign up manually.

Temporarily run the container with the following command:

**For ARM platforms:**

```shell
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/fr24feed ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-flightradar24:latest --signup
```

**For other platforms:**

```shell
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint qemu-arm-static ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-flightradar24:latest /usr/local/bin/fr24feed --signup
```

This will take you through the signup process. Most of the answers don't matter as during normal operation the configuration will be set with environment variables. I would suggest answering as follows:

* `Step 1.1 - Enter your email address (username@domain.tld)`: Enter your email address.
* `Step 1.2 - If you used to feed FR24 with ADS-B data before, enter your sharing key.`: Leave blank and press enter.
* `Step 1.3 - Would you like to participate in MLAT calculations?`: Answer `no`.
* `Would you like to continue using these settings?`: Answer `yes`.
* `Step 4.1 - Receiver selection (in order to run MLAT please use DVB-T stick with dump1090 utility bundled with fr24feed)... Enter your receiver type (1-7)`: Answer `7`.
* `Step 6 - Please select desired logfile mode... Select logfile mode (0-2)`: Answer `0`.

At the end of the signup process, you'll be presented with:

```
Congratulations! You are now registered and ready to share ADS-B data with Flightradar24.
+ Your sharing key (xxxxxxxxxxxx) has been configured and emailed to you for backup purposes.
+ Your radar id is X-XXXXXXX, please include it in all email communication with us.
```

Take a note of the sharing key, as you'll need it when launching the container.

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \

 -e BEASTHOST=beasthost \
 -e FR24KEY=xxxxxxxxxxx \
 -p 8754:8754 \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-flightradar24:latest
```

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

```shell
